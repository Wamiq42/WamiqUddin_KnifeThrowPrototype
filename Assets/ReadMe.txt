I chose this game because it has this sticking phenomenan i haven't implemented such kind of phenomena before.
I did manage to get stuck time to time but Alhamdullillah I managed to solve the problems i was having.
The main problem i couldn't solve for the long time was spawning the knives and adding force on them using same button.
Most of my time was spent on trying to fix that problem (which i will keep trying even after submission).
